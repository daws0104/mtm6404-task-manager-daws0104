##This is my task manager

This task manager meant to keep track of all my **gaming** tasks. It is divided into categories based on the game including **Final fantasy 14, Terraria** and **Satisfactory.** 

###For later iterations:

*thIs depends on future assignment requirements*

Change the tasks to an array, have a section to add new tasks and have the ability to push the new tasks onto the array.
